# ASG - Auto Scaling Groups

- Auto Scaling Groups provide auto scaling for EC2
- Provide the ability to implement a self-healing architecture
- ASGs make use of configurations defined in launch templates or launch configurations
- ASGs are using one version of a launch template/configuration
- ASG have 3 important values defined: *Minimum*, *Desired* and *Maximum* size. Desired size has to be more than the minimum size and less than Maximum size.
- ASG provides on foundational job: keeps the size of running instances at the desired size
- Archechturally ASG define where the EC2 instances are launcehd. They are attcahed to VPC and which subnets are configured within the VPC in ACG. 
- **Scaling Policies**: update the desired capacity based on some metric (CPU usage, number of connections, etc.)
    - They are essentially rules defined by us which can adjust the values of an ASG
    - Scaling policies are used with ASG.
    - Scaling types:
        - **Manual Scaling** : Manually adjusts the desired capcacity.
        - **Scheduled Scaling**: Scheduling based on know time window
        - **Dynamic Scaling**
        - **Predictive Scaling**: scale based on historical load to detect patterns in traffic flows
- Dynamic Scaling has 3 subtypes:
    - **Simple Scaling**: Based on Metric. Example "CPU above 50%  +1", "CPU Below 50% -1"
    - **Step Scaling**: scaling based on difference, allowing to react quicker
    - **Target Tracking**: example desired aggregate CPU = 40%. Not all metrics are supported by target tracking scaling
- **Cooldown Period**: a value in seconds, controls how long to wait after a scaling action happened before starting another action
- ASG monitor the health of instances, by default using the EC2 health checks
- ASG can integrate with load balancers: ASG can add/remove instances from a LB target group
- ASG can use the LB health checks in case of EC2 health checks

## Scaling Processes

- `Launch` and `Terminate`: if Launch is suspended, the ASG wont scale out / if Terminate is suspended the ASG wont scale in
- `AddToLoadBalancer`: add instance to LB
- `AlarmNotification`: control is the ASG reacts to CloudWatch alarms
- `AZRebalance`: balances instances evenly across all of AZs
- `HealthCheck`: controls if instance health checks are on/off
- `ReplaceUnhealthy`: controls if instances are replaced in case there are unhealthy
- `ScheduledActions`: controls if scheduled actions are on/off
- `Standby`: suspend any activities of ASG in a specific instance

## ASG Consideration

- ASG are free, we pay only for the instances provisioned
- We should use cool downs to avoid rapid scaling
- We should use smaller instances for granularity
- ASG integrates with ALBs
- ASG defines when and where, LT defines what

## Lifecycle Hooks

- Allow to configure custom actions which can occur during ASG actions
- When an ASG scales out/in instances may pause within the flow to allow execution of lifecycle hooks
- We can specify a timeout (36000s by default) for the lifecycle action, after the pause the system can decide if the ASG process continues or is abandoned
- We can resume the ASG process by calling `CompleteLifecycleAction`
- Lifecycle event hooks can be integrated with EventBridge or SNS notifications

## Scaling Policies

- ASGs don't need scaling policies, they can work just fine with none
- When created without a scaling policy, an ASG has static values for `MinSize`, `MaxSize` and `Desired` capacity
- Manual scaling: we manually adjust the values listed before; useful for testing or urgent situations or when we need to hold capacity at fixed number of instances
- In addition to manual scaling, we had different types of dynamic scaling policies. Each of these adjusts the desired capacity of an ASG based on a certain criteria
- Dynamic scaling policies:
    - **Simple Scaling**:
        - We define action which occur when a alarm goes to ALARM state. For example: add one instance if `CPUUtilization` is above 40%
        - Helps infrastructure scale out/in based on demand
        - This scaling is inflexible, add/remove static number of instances based on the status of an alarm
    - **Step Scaling**:
        - Adjust number of instances based on a number of step adjustments, that wary based on the size of the alarm brige
        - Example:
            - If the CPU usage is between 50-60%, do nothing
            - If the CPU usage is between 60 and 70%, add one instance
            - If the CPU usage is between 70 and 80%, add two instances
            - Finally, add 3 instances if the CPU usage is above 80%
        - Generally is better compared to Simple Scaling, allows us to adjust better to change load patterns
    - **Target Tracking**:
        - Comes with a predefined set of metrics: `CPUUtilization`, `AvgNetworkIn`, `AvgNetworkOut`, `AlbRequestCountPerTarget`
        - We define an ideal value, a target we want to track against for a supported metric
        - The ASG calculates the scaling adjustment based on the metric and the target value
        - The ASG keeps the metric at the target value we specified and adjusts the capacity as required
    - Scaling based on SQS - `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible`:
        - Scaling is done based on the number of messages currently in the SQS queue
    - **Predictive Scaling**:
        - Predictive scaling uses historical data load to detect patterns in traffic flows and scale accordingly
        - Needs at least 24 hours of data to work, if available uses the past 14 days of data to analyze patterns
        - When enabled it will run in `forecast only` mode, in which no autoscaling action will take place. It will generate capacity forecasts which will allow us to evaluate the accuracy and the suitability of the autoscaling
        - After we review it, it will switch to `forecast and scale` mode
        - Maximum capacity limit: maximum number of EC2 instances that can be launched. We can allow the groups maximum capacity to be automatically increased
        - A core assumption of predictive scaling is that the Auto Scaling group is homogenous and all instances are of equal capacity. If this isnâ€™t true, forecasted capacity can be inaccurate
- AWS recommends using Step Scaling instead of Simple Scaling policy

## ASG Health Checks

- ASGs assess the health of instances within their group using health checks
- If an instance fails health checks, it is replaced within the group => automatic healing
- There 3 different types of health checks that can be used by ASGs:
    - EC2 (default)
    - ELB (can be enabled)
    - Custom
- With EC2 health checks any of these statuses are viewed as unhealthy: Stopping, Stopped, Terminated, Shutting Down, Impaired (not 2/2 status checks)
- With ELB health checks in instance to be viewed as healthy it should be running and it should be passing the ELB health checks
- ELB health checks can be more application aware (Layer 7)
- Custom health checks: instances can be marked healthy/unhealthy by an external system
- Health check grace period:
    - It is configurable value, by default is 300s
    - It is a delay before health checks starting to check on a specific instance
    - Allows system launch, bootstrapping and application start
