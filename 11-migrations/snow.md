    - Compute optimized: 100TB + 7.68 NVME, 52vCPU, 208Gib RAM
    - Compute optimized with GPU: 100TB + 7.68 NVME, 52vCPU, 208Gib RAM, GPU
- Ideal for remote sites or where data processing on ingestion is needed

## Snowmobile

- Portable data center within a shipping container on a truck
- Needs to be specially ordered from AWS
- Ideal for single location when 10 PB+ is required
- Can store up to 100PB of data per Snowmobile
- Not economical for multi-site or sub 10PB
