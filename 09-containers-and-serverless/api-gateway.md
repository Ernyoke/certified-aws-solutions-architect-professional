# API Gateway

- Is a service which lets us create and manage APIs
- API Gateway acts as endpoint or entry-point applications which want to talk with our services
- Sits between the application and integrations (services)
- API Gateway is HA and scalable
- Handles authorization, throttling, caching, CORS, transformations
- It also supports the OpenAPI spec and direct integration with other AWS services
- API gateway is a public service
- It can provide APIs using REST and WebSocket

## Authentication

- API Gateway supports a range of authentication types such as Cognito, Lambda based authentication (Custom based authentication - we can assume the client uses a Bearer token) and IAM credentials
- We can allow APIs to be open access without authentication

## Endpoint Types

- **Edge-Optimized**: any incoming request is routed to the nearest CloudFront POP (point of presence)
- **Region**: region endpoint for clients in the same region, it does not utilize the CloudFront endpoint
- **Private**: endpoints only accessible in a VPC via interface endpoints

## Stages

- When we deploy an API configuration, we are doing it into a stage
- Example we can have prod/dev stage with uniq settings and urls
- Deployments can be rolled back on a stage
- On stages we can enable canary deployments. When enabled, the deployment will be made to the canary not the stage itself
- Traffic distribution can be altered between canary and base stage
- Canary stage can be promoted to base

##  Errors

- `4XX` - Client errors: invalid request on the client side
- `5XX` - Server errors: valid request, backend issue
- `400 - Bad Request`: generic client side error
- `403 - Access Denied`: authorizer denies request, request is WAF filtered
- `429` - API Gateway can throttle: this means we have exceeded a specified amount of requests
- `502 - Bad Gateway Exception`: bad output returned by Lambda
- `503 - Service Unavailable`: backing endpoint is offline
- `504` - Integration Failure/Timeout (29s limit)

## Caching

- Caching is configured per stage
- We can define a cache on a stage (500 MB up to 237 GB)
- Cache TTL default value is 300 seconds, configurable between 0 and 3600s. Can be encrypted
- Calls only will reach the backend in case of a cache miss

## Methods and Resources

- API Gateway URL example: `https://1nj7i16t37.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/listcats`
- The URL can be represents the following: `[api-gateway-endpoint]/[stage]/[resource]`
- Stages are logical configurations. APIs are deployed into stages. Stages can be used for different application versions or lifecycle points for an API
- API changes only take effect after it is deployed into a stage
- Methods are the desired action to be performed. Methods are HTTP verbs
- Methods are where integrations are configured which provide the functionality of an API. Methods can integrate with Lambda, HTTP and other AWS services

## Integrations

- API Gateway is capable of connecting to Lambda, HTTP Endpoints (running on-premises or on AWS), Step Functions, SNS, DynamoDB
- APIs have 3 phases:
    - Request: authorize, validate and transform the request
    - Integrations
    - Response: transform, prepare and return the response
- The request and response phases are split into 2 parts:
    - Method Request: defines everything about the client request to method (path, headers, parameters)
    - Integration Request: parameters from the method request are transferred to the integrations
    - Integration Response: converts the data from the backend to a form which can be sent back to the client
    - Method Response: how the communication is delivered back to the client
- API methods which are on the client side decide what the client request to method is like. There are integrated to a backend endpoint via integrations
- Integration types:
    - **MOCK**: used for testing, no backed involved. It returns a static response
    - **HTTP**: http custom integration, backend is a HTTP endpoint. We have to configure both integration request and integration response
    - **HTTP Proxy**: subtype of the HTTP integration, but where proxying is utilized. Allows the access HTTP endpoint with a streamline integration. Proxying is where the request is passed to the endpoint as is and sent back to the client as is
    - **AWS**: allows an API to expose AWS services. We have to configure both the integration request and response and setup necessary mappings from the method request to the integration request. Can be used with Lambda functions, but it is relatively complex way of using it with Lambda
    - **AWS_PROXY (LAMBDA)**: integration request/response does not have to be defined, API Gateway passes the request unmodified
- Mapping template: used for non-proxy integrations. Used for:
    - Modify or rename parameters
    - Modify the body or header of the request
    - Filtering - remove anything from the request

## Mapping Templates

- Used for AWS and HTTP (non proxy) integrations
- It is able modify and rename parameters between the integrations
- It can modify the body or the headers of a request
- It can provide filtering by removing anything which is not needed
- Mapping uses VTL (Velocity Template Langue) for editing the request
- Use cases for mapping templates:
    - Integrate a REST API on API Gateway with a SOAP API

## Stages and Deployments

- Editing an API, we are editing settings which are not live (not published)
- The current state of the API needs to be deployed to a stage
- Each stage has its own configuration. Configurations are not immutable, can be modified, overwritten or rolled back
- Stage variables: environment variables for stages

## Swagger and OpenAPI

- OpenAPI (OAS) defines a standard language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs
- OpenAPI v2 is formerly known as Swagger
- OpenAPI v3 is a more recent version
- OpenAPI defines endpoints, operation (GET, POST, etc.), input and output parameters and authentication methods
- API Gateway is capable of import OpenAPI format and generating it. Useful for backups and migrations
