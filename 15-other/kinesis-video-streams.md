# Kinesis Video Streams

- Allows us to ingest live video data from producers
- Producers can be security cameras, smartphones, cars, drones, time-serialised audio, thermal, depth and RADAR data
- Consumers can access the data frame-by-frame or as needed
- Kinesis can persist and encrypt data in-transit and at rest
- We can not access data directly via storage, only via APIs!
- Data is not stored in its original format. Data is indexed and stored in a structured way
- Kinesis Video Streams integrates with other AWS services such as Rekognition and Connect
