# AWS Shield

- Provides protection against DDoS attacks
- Provides a custom designed set of protection against DDoS attacks
- Offers protection against all known infrastructure Layer 3 and Layer 4 DDoS attacks: Network Volumetric attacks (L3), Network Protocol Attacks (L4) for example TCP SYN Floods
- Comes in 2 forms:
    - **Shield Standard**:
        - It is free of charge for all AWS customers
        - Protection is at the perimeter of the network (this can be either at the region/VPC or AWS edge in case of CloudFront usage)
        - Protects against common Network (L3) and Transport (L4) layer attacks
        - We get the best protection if we use Route 53, CloudFront or Global Accelerator
        - It does not provide anything against proactive capability of any form of explicit configurable configuration
    - **Shield Advanced**:
        - Costs $3000 per month per organization, 1 year lock-in + charge for data (OUT) / month. Cost is not per account, if we want protection for multiple accounts, we have to make sure they are in the same organization
        - Expands the range of products which can be protected: CloudFront, Global Accelerator, Route53, anything associated with am EIP (example EC2 instances), load balancers (ALB, CLB, NLB)
        - Protection offered by Shield Advanced is not automatic. We need to enable it in Shield Advanced or as part as AWS Firewall Manager Shield Advanced policy
        - Shield Advanced provides access to 24/7 advanced response team named AWS Shield Response Team (SRT)
        - Provides financial insurance for any increase of payments in case of DDoS attacks
        - Additional Shield Advanced features
            - Integration with WAF:
                - Shield Advanced integrates with WAF to protect against Application Layer (L7) attacks
                - Includes basic AWS WAF fees for web ACLs, rules and web requests
            - Real time visibility of DDOS events and attacks
            - Health-based detection: application specific health checks used by proactive engagement team to provide faster detection and mitigation of any issues
            - Protection groups:
                - We can create grouping of resources that Shield Advanced protects
                - We can define the criteria of membership for groups, any new resource will automatically be added
