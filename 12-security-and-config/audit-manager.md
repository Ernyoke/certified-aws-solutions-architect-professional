# AWS Audit Manager

- AWS Audit Manager helps us continually audit our AWS usage to simplify how we manage risk and compliance with regulations and industry standards
- Audit Manager provides prebuilt frameworks that structure and automate assessments for a given compliance standard or regulation
- We can create an assessment from any framework
- Audit Manager automatically runs resource assessments. These assessments collect data for the AWS accounts that we define as in scope for your audit
- After we complete an audit and we no longer need Audit Manager to collect evidence, we can stop evidence collection
