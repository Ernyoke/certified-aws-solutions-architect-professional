# AWS Proton

- It is:
    - Automated infrastructure as code provisioning and deployment of serverless and container-based applications:
        - AWS Proton service is a two-pronged automation framework
        - We create versioned **service templates** that define standardized infrastructure and deployment tooling for serverless and container-based applications
        - AWS Proton identifies all existing service instances that are using an outdated template version for us
        - We can request AWS Proton to upgrade them with one click
    - Standardized infrastructure:
        - Platform teams can use AWS Proton and versioned infrastructure as code templates
    - Deployments integrated with CI/CD:
        - AWS Proton automatically provisions the resources, configures the CI/CD pipeline, and deploys the code into the defined infrastructure
