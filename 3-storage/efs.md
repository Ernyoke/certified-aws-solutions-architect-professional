# EFS - Elastic File System

- It is a network based file system which can be mounted on Linux based instance
- Can be mounted to multiple instances at once
- EFS it is an implementation of the NFSv4 file system format
- EFS file systems can be mounted in a folder in Linux based operating systems
- EFS storage exists separately from the lifecycle of an EC2 instance
- It can be shared between many EC2 instances
- It is a private service, it can be mounted via mount targets inside a VPC. By default an EFS it is isolated to the VPC in which was provisioned
- EFS can be accessed outside of the VPC over hybrid networking: VPN or DX. EFS is a great tool for storage handling across multiple units of compute
- EFS is accessible for Lambda functions. Lambda has to be configured to use VPC networking in order to use EFS
- Mount targets: provide IP addresses in the range of the VPC. For HA we should provision mount targets in every availability zones present in a VPC
- EFS offers 2 performance modes:
    - General Purpose: ideal for latency sensitive use cases (it is the default)
    - Max I/O: can be used to scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput. Has higher latencies
- EFS offers 2 different throughput modes:
    - Bursting (default): works similar to EBS GP2 storage
    - Provisioned: we can specify throughput requirements independent of the size
- EFS offers 2 storage classes:
    - Standard
    - Infrequent Access (IA)
- We can automatically move data between these 2 classes using lifecycle policies
