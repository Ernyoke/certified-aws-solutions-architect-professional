# CloudFormation

## Physical and Logical Resources

- CloudFormation begins with a template defined in YAML or JSON file
- The template contains logical resources (what we want to create)
- Templates can be used to create CloudFormation Stacks (one ore many stacks)
- The initial job of a stack is to create physical resources based on the logical resources defined in the template
- If a stack's template are changed, physical resources are changed as well
- If a stack is deleted, normally the physical resources are deleted

## Stacks

- A stack is a collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit
- All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's CloudFormation template
- Stack options:
    - Tags: key/value pairs attached to the stack. Can be used to identify the stack for cost allocation purposes
    - Permissions: IAM service role that can be assumed by CloudFormation
    - Stack failure options:
        - Specifies what to do if something fails while the stack is provisioned
        - Options:
            - Roll back all stack resources
            - Preserve successfully provisioned resources
    - Stack policy: defines the resources that we want to protect from unintentional updates during a stack update
    - Rollback configuration: we can monitor the stack while it is being created/updated and we can roll it back in case a threshold is breached (example if any alarm goes to ALARM state)
    - Notification options: we can specify an SNS topic where notifications should go
    - Stack creation options: following options are included for stack creation, but aren't available as part of stack updates:
        - Timeout: Specifies the amount of time, in minutes, that CloudFormation should allot before timing out stack creation operations

## Template Parameters and Pseudo Parameters

- Template parameters allow input via the console, CLI or API when the stack is created or updated
- Parameters are defined within the resources and they can be referenced from within the logical resources
- Parameters can have default values, allowed values, min/max length, allowed patterns, no echo (useful for passwords, the value is not displayed when typed) and types
- Pseudo Parameters: 
    - AWS makes available parameters which can be referenced by the CF template
    - Example:
        - `AWS::Region`
        - `AWS::StackId`
        - `AWS::StackName`
        - `AWS::AccountId`
    - Pseudo parameters are parameters which can not be populated by us, they are populated by AWS and provided for us to reference them
- Parameters provide portability for the template
- Best practice:
    - Minimize number of parameters and provide defaults where applicable
    - Use pseudo parameters where possible

## Intrinsic Functions

- Intrinsic functions can be used in templates to assign values to properties that are not available until runtime
- Examples of functions:
    - `Ref` and `Fn::GetAtt`: reference a value from one logical resource
    - `Fn::Join` and `Fn::Split`: join/split strings to create new ones
    - `Fn::GetAZs` and `Fn::Select`: get availability zones in a regions and select one
    - Conditions: `Fn::IF`, `And`, `Equals`, `Not`, `Or`
    - `Fn::Base64` and `Fn::Sub`: encode strings to base64, substitute replacement on variables in the text
    - `Fn:Cidr`: build CIDR blocks
- `Fn::GetAZs` - returns the available AZs in region. If the region has a default VPC configured, it return the AZs which are available in the default VPC

## Mappings

- Templates can contain a `Mappings` objects which can contain keys to values objects
- Mappings can have one level or tep and second level keys
- Mappings use another intrinsic function `Fn::FindInMap`
- Mappings are used to improve template portability
- Example:
    ```
    Mappings:
        RegionMap:
            us-east-1:
                HVM64: 'ami-xxx'
                HVMG2: 'ami-yyy'
            us-east-2:
                HVM64: 'ami-zzz'
                HVMG2: 'ami-vvv'
    ```

## Outputs

- The `Outputs` section in a template is optional
- We can declare values in this section which will be visible as output in the CLI/Console
- Output will be accessible from a parent stack when using nesting
- Outputs can be exported allowing cross-stack references
- Example:
    ```
    Outputs:
        WordPressUrl:
            Description: 'description text'
            Value: !Join['', 'https://', !GetAtt Instance.DNSName]
    ```

## Conditions

- Allows stack to react to certain conditions and change infrastructure based on those
- They declared in an optional section named `Conditions`
- We can declare many conditions, each of them being evaluated to `TRUE` or `FALSE`
- Conditions are evaluated before resources are created
- Conditions use other intrinsic functions: `AND`, `EQUALS`, `IF`, `NOT`, `OR`
- Any resource can have associated a condition which will define if the resource will be created or not
- Examples: we can have conditions which evaluate based on the environment (dev, test, prod) in which the template is executed
- Condition example:
    ```
    Conditions:
        IsProd: !Equals
            - !Ref EnvType
            - `prod`
    ```
- Conditions can be nested

## DependsOn

- Allows us to establish dependencies between resources
- CFN tried to be efficient by creating/updating/deleting resources in parallel
- Also, it tries to determine a dependency order (example: VPC => SUBNET => EC2) by using references or functions
- Dependency can be defined using the `DependsOn` property specify the resource on which we depend on
- `DependsOn` can accept a single resource or a list of resources

## Creation Policies, Wait Conditions and cfn-signal

- Creation Policies, Wait Conditions and cfn-signals provide a few ways to notify CFN with details signals on completion or not of creation of resources
- We can configure CFN to wait for a certain number of success signals
- We also configure a timeout within which the signals are received (max 12H)
- The the number of success signals are received within the timeout, CFN stacks moves to `CREATE_COMPLETE`
- `cfn-signal` is an utility running on the EC2 instances sending success/failure signals to CFN
- If the timeout is reached and the number of success signals are not met, the stack will fail creation
- For provisioning EC2 and ASG, we should us a `CreationPolicy`
- For other requirements we might chose to use a `WaitCondition`
- A `WaitCondition` is defined as a logical resource, meaning it can have `DependsOn` property. It can be used as a general progress gait in the template
- A `WaitCondition` relies on a `WaitHandle`, which is another logical resource. Its job is to generate a presigned url which can be used to send signals to `WaitCondition`
- With `WaitHandle` we can pass back data to the template. This data can be retrieved using the `!GetAtt WaitCondition.Data` function

## Nested Stacks

- Most simple projects will generally utilize a CFN stack
- Stacks can have limits:
    - Resource limit: 500 resources per stack
    - We can't easily reuse resources, example reference a VPC
- There are 2 ways to architect multi-stack projects:
    - Nested Stacks
    - Cross-Stack References
- Nested Stacks:
    - Root Stack: the stack which is created first, created manually or using some automation
    - A Parent Stack is the parent of any stack which it immediately creates
    - A root stack can create nested stacks having several parent stacks
    - A root stack can have parameters and outputs (just like a normals stack)
- A stack can have another CFN stack as a resource using `AWS::CloudFormation::Stack` type which needs an url to the template
- We can provide input values to the nested stacks. We need to supply values to any parameters from a nested stack if the parameter does not have a default value defined
- Any outputs of a nested stack are returned to the root stack which can be referenced as `NESTEDStack.Outputs.XXX`
- Benefits of a nested stack is to reuse the same template, not the actual stack created
- We should use nested stacks when we want to link the life cycles of different stacks

## Cross-Stack References

- CFN stacks are designed to be isolated and self-contained
- With nested stacks we can reuse code only, with cross-stack references we can reference resources created by other stacks
- Outputs are normally not visible from other stacks, exception being nested stacks which case the parent stack can reference the nested stack output
- Outputs of a template can be exported making them visible from other stacks
- Exports must have unique names in the region
- To use the exported resources we can use `Fn::ImportValue` intrinsic function
- Cross-region or cross-account is not supported for cross-stack references

## StackSets

- Allows to create/update/delete infrastructure across many regions or many accounts
- StackSets are containers in an admin account (account where the StackSet is applied, it does not have to be any special account)
- StackSets contain stack instances (containers for individual stacks) which reference stacks
- Stack instances and stacks are created in target accounts
- Each stack created by a StackSet is a stack created in one region in one account
- Security: we can use self-managed roles or service-managed roles (everything handled by the product). CFN will assume a role to interact with the target accounts
- Terminology:
    - Concurrent Accounts: a value specifying how in how many accounts can we deploy at the same time
    - Failure Tolerance: amount of individual deployments which can fail before declaring the StackSet itself as failed
    - Retain Stacks: remove stack instances from a StackSet but retain the infrastructure
- StackSet use cases:
    - Crate AWS Config Rules
    - Create IAM Roles for cross-account access

## DeletionPolicy

- If we delete a logical resource from a template, by default the physical resource will be deleted by CFN
- With certain type of resources this can cause data loss
- With deletion policy, we can define on each resource to **Delete** (default), **Retain** or **Snapshot** (if supported)
- Supported resources for snapshot are: EBS volumes, ElastiCache, Neptune, RDS, Redshift
- With snapshot before the physical resource is deleted, a snapshot is taken
- Deletion policies only apply to delete operation, NOT replace operation!

## Stack Roles

- By default CFN uses the permissions of the identity who initiates the stack creation
- CFN stack roles is feature where CFN can assume a role to gain permissions to create resources from a stack without the need for the initiator to have the necessary permissions
- The identity creating the stack does not need resource permissions, only `PassRole`

## `AWS::CloudFormation::Init` and `cfn-init`

- CloudFormationInit is a simple configuration management system
- Configuration directive are stored in the template
- `AWS::CloudFormation::Init` is part of EC2 instance logical resource. With this we can specify configurations which will be applied to the created EC2 instance
- User Data is procedural (HOW should things to be done) / `cfn-init` is a desired state (WHAT we want to occur)
- `cfn-init` can be cross-platform and idempotent
- Accessing the CFN init data is done with the `cfn-init` helper script which should be installed on the instance

## `cfn-hup`

- `cfn-init` is a helper tool running once as part of bootstrapping (user data)
- If the `AWS::CloudFormation::Init` is updated, `cfn-init` is not rerun
- `cfn-hup` is a helper tool which can be installed on EC2 instances
- It will detect changes in the resources metadata
- When change is detected, it can run configurable actions. It might rerun `cfn-init` if necessary

## Change Sets

- Change Sets let us preview the changes that will happen after we update a stack
- We can have multiple change sets and preview each of them
- We can chose which change set we want to apply by executing it

## Custom Resources

- CloudFormation doesn't support everything in AWS
- Custom Resources let CFN integrate with anything it does not yet support or wont support at all
- With Custom Resources we can extend CFN to do things which it does not natively support (example: fet configuration from a third party)
- Architecture of custom resources:
    - CFN sends data to an endpoint defined in the custom resource
    - This endpoint might be a Lambda function or an SNS topic
    - When a custom resources is created/update/deleted, CFN sends events to this endpoint containing the operation and any additional property information
    - The compute (Lambda function) can respond to this custom data, letting it know of the success/failure of its execution
