# AD Connector (Directory Services)

- AD Connector provides a pair of directory endpoints in a VPC
- It injects ENIs into to subnets in a VPC
- Once injected AD connector appears as a native directory to other AWS instances capable of using a directory service
- Redirects requests to an existing on-premise directory server, which means no directory data is stored in AWS
- AD connector allows us to use AWS services which do require an AD directory (such as Workspaces) and use this with an on-premises directory service => we don't need to deploy additional AD directory in AWS
- **There are 2 sizes of directory services *small* and *large*, while there are no explicit user limits, the chosen size does impact the amount of compute allocated by AWS for the connector**
- **We can use multiple connector to distribute the load**
- AD directory is placed in 2 subnets in a VPCs in different availability zones => resilient to AZ failure
- The connector should be configured to point to at least one on-premise directory service => we need to provide account information for the connector to be able to authenticate itself
- **Requires a working network to on-premise service, otherwise wont work (private network via Direct Connect or VPN)**

## Use cases for AD Connector

- Prof of concept projects, we don't want to move our Active Directory to AWS for it
- We have a small infrastructure in AWS and we don't want to move the Active Directory to AWS
- Legal/compliance reasons - we don't want to store user info in AWS
- For larger requirements use AWS Directory Service
